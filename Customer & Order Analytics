#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
    
    SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> '';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
    
    SELECT COUNT(Product) FROM JanSales
    WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
    AND length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
    
    SELECT distinct cust.acctnum FROM customers cust
    JOIN FebSales feb
    ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
    WHERE length(order_id) = 6
    AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
    
    SELECT product, MIN(price) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
    GROUP BY product, price 
    ORDER BY price
    LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
    
    SELECT Product, Quantity, price, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Product_Revenue FROM JanSales
    GROUP BY Product
    ORDER BY Product_Revenue DESC;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
    
    SELECT Product, location, Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Product_Revenue FROM FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    AND length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
    
    SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) AS Avg_Spent FROM customers
    JOIN FebSales
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.OrderID
    WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
    AND FebSales.Quantity <> 'Quantity Ordered'
    AND length(FebSales.orderID) = 6;
