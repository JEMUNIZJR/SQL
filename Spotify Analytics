# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#Creating the table: 

  CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  (id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_name varchar NOT NULL,
  track_id varchar NOT NULL,
  popularity integer NOT NULL,
  danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  key integer NOT NULL,
  loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
  mode integer NOT NULL,
  speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
  acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
  instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
  liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
  valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
  tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
  duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
  time_signature integer NOT NULL)


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


#1. I browsed the data to see what kind of questions I could answer with the data.

    SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#2. I determined how many songs each artist has in the top 50.
  
    SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) desc
    LIMIT 10;

#3. I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

    SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy) FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
    ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc, AVG(danceability) desc, AVG(energy) desc;

#4. I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity

    SELECT artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 10;


#5. I determined which songs are the top 10 by popularity

    SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY track_name
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 10;


#6. I determined which artists released a song with the longest duration.
    
    SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY duration_ms desc
    LIMIT 3;
