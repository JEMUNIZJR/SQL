# In this SQL code I am showing the process of my code while completing the SQL Murder Mystery game from mystery.knightlab.com
# The game objective is to find the person who committed the murder using SQL from the database in the game


-- I first began to review the different tables and what data they contain

    SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE type = 'table';
  
    SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master
    WHERE name = '```insert table name here```';

-- I first started by finding the incident in the crime scene report

    SELECT type, city, description FROM crime_scene_report
    WHERE type = 'murder'
    AND city = 'SQL City';

-- I then identified the witnesses

    SELECT name, address_number, address_street_name FROM person
    WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
    ORDER BY address_number desc
    LIMIT 1;
    
    SELECT name, address_number, address_street_name FROM person
    WHERE name LIKE '%Annabel%'
    AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave';

-- I then found their interview statements

    SELECT p.name, i.transcript FROM person p
    JOIN interview iON p.id = i.person_id
    WHERE p.name = 'Morty Schapiro'
    OR p.name = 'Annabel Miller';

-- Next, I searched for the suspect based on the witnesses statements

    SELECT p.name, gfn.id, gfn.membership_status, dl.plate_number FROM person p
    JOIN get_fit_now_member gfn
    ON p.id = gfn.person_id
    JOIN drivers_license dl
    ON p.license_id = dl.id
    WHERE gfn.id LIKE '48Z%'
    AND dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

-- I then entered the name of the suspect into the solution

    INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, '```Insert murderer name here```');
    
    SELECT value FROM solution;


# Upon entering the answer there was a message that appeared
# It stated:

# "Congrats, you found the murderer! 
# But wait, there's more...
# If you think you're up for a challenge, 
# try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime.
# If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills,
# try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries.
# Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer."


-- I continued to query the transcript from the person who committed the murder

    SELECT p.name, i.transcript FROM person p
    JOIN interview i
    ON p.id = i.person_id
    WHERE p.name = '```Insert murderer name here';

-- I then wrote a query to find the person behind the murder based on the transcript

    SELECT p.name, dl.height, dl.hair_color, dl.car_make, dl.car_model, fb.event_name, fb.date FROM person p
    JOIN drivers_license dl
    ON p.license_id = dl.id
    JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb
    ON p.id = fb.person_id
    WHERE dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
    AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
    AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
    AND dl.car_model LIKE '%S%'
    AND fb.event_name LIKE '%Symphony%'
    AND fb.date LIKE '201712__'

-- After finding the culprit I entered the name into the solution

    INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
    
    SELECT value FROM solution;


# Upon entering the name another message appeared stating:

# Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder!
# Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time.
# Time to break out the champagne!
