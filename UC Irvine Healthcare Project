# In this project I will be pretend I was hired by UC Irvine Health to gather insights from their healthcare data.
# The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/data?select=diabetic_data.csv


# 1. What does the distribution of time spent in the hospital looks like? Do the majority of patients stay less than 7 days?

        SELECT ROUND(time_in_hospital, 1) AS duration, 
        COUNT(*) AS count,
        RPAD('', COUNT(*)/100, '*') AS bar 
        FROM health
        GROUP BY duration
        ORDER BY duration;

#        Result: A histogram showing that the majority of patients do stay shorter than 7 days. (3 days- most, 2 days- second most, 1 day- third most, 4 days- fourth most, etc.)

# 2. What medical specialties are doing the most number of procedures on average? Gather a list of the average number of procedures for all the specialties.

        SELECT medical_specialty, ROUND(AVG(num_procedures),2) AS avg_procedures, COUNT(*) AS count FROM health
        GROUP BY medical_specialty
        HAVING count >= 50
        AND avg_procedures >= 2.5
        ORDER BY avg_procedures desc;

#        Result: List of medical specialties, average procedures, and count of the number of patients.
#        Note: The director is looking for a list of specialties with more than 50 patients and the average amount of procedures to be above 2.5

        SELECT medical_specialty, ROUND(AVG(num_procedures),2) AS avg_procedures, COUNT(*) AS count FROM health
        GROUP BY medical_specialty
        HAVING count >= 50
        AND avg_procedures >= 2.5
        ORDER BY avg_procedures desc;

#        Result: Surgery: Thoracic – 3.5 (avg_procedures) – 109 (patients) | Surgery: Cardio/Thoracic – 3.2 – 652 | Radiologist – 3.2 – 1140 | Cardiology – 2.7 – 5352 | Surgery: Vascular – 2.6 – 533 

# 3. Is the hospital treating patients of different races differently? Specifically with the number of lab procedures done.

        SELECT dem.race, ROUND(AVG(heal.num_lab_procedures),2), COUNT(*) AS count FROM demographics dem
        JOIN health heal
        ON dem.patient_nbr = heal.patient_nbr
        GROUP BY dem.race
        ORDER BY AVG(heal.num_lab_procedures) desc;

#        Result: (African American – 44.46 | ? – 44.28 | Other – 43.58 | Caucasian – 42.61 | Asian – 42.19 | Hispanic – 41.81)
#        Note: No major differences in the average lab procedures across races.

# 4. Do patients with multiple lab procedures stay in the hospital longer? / What is the correlation between the number of lab procedures and the 

        SELECT MIN(num_lab_procedures), AVG(num_lab_procedures), MAX(num_lab_procedures) FROM health;
#        Note: Checking the minimum, average, and maximum number of lab procedures done to create categories for the amounts (few, average, many).

        SELECT ROUND(AVG(time_in_hospital),2) AS avg_time,
        CASE
        	WHEN num_lab_procedures >= 0 AND num_lab_procedures <= 33 THEN 'Few Procedures'
            WHEN num_lab_procedures >=34 AND num_lab_procedures <= 65 THEN 'Average Procedures'
            ELSE 'Many Procedures'
            END AS procedure_frequency
        FROM health
        GROUP BY procedure_frequency
        ORDER BY avg_time_in_hospital desc;

#        Result: 6.41 (avg_time) – Many Procedures | 4.46 – Average Procedures | 3.38 – Few Procedures
#        Note: There is a correlation. Patients with longer stays tend to have more procedures done.

# 5. I need a list of patient IDs who are African American and are taking metformin (for a medical test being done by the research department).

        SELECT patient_nbr FROM demographics
        WHERE race = 'AfricanAmerican'
        UNION
        SELECT patient_nbr FROM health
        WHERE metformin = 'Up';

#        Result: List of patient numbers who meet the criteria.

# 6. Provide a list of patients who were an emergency admissions but stayed less than the average time in the hospital (highlighting the success stories of the hospital).

        SELECT * FROM health
        WHERE admission_type_id = 1
        AND time_in_hospital < (SELECT AVG(time_in_hospital) FROM health);

        OR

        WITH avg_time AS (SELECT AVG(time_in_hospital) FROM health)
        SELECT * FROM health
        WHERE admission_type_id = 1
        AND time_in_hospital < (SELECT * FROM avg_time);

#        Result: List of data that meets the criteria of emergency admissions & lower than average time spent in the hospital.

# 7. Our boss has asked us to write a summary for the top 50 medication patients.
#        They want the format like this: "Patient 2383 was Caucasian and was readmitted. They had 21 medications and 32 lab procedures."

        SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', 'Patient', d.patient_nbr, 'was', d.race, 'and',
        (CASE
        	WHEN h.readmitted = 'NO' THEN 'was not'
            ELSE 'was'
        END),
        'readmitted. They had', h.num_medications, 'medications and', h.num_lab_procedures, 'lab procedures.') AS summary
        FROM health h
        JOIN demographics d
        ON h.patient_nbr = d.patient_nbr
        ORDER BY h.num_medications desc, h.num_lab_procedures desc
        LIMIT 50;

#        Result: Patient 30281670 was Hispanic and was not readmitted. They had 9 medications and 96 lab procedures. | Patient 23964678 was Caucasian and was not readmitted. They had 9 medications and 94 lab procedures. | Patient 85246299 was Caucasian and was readmitted. They had 9 medications and 90 lab procedures. | etc.
