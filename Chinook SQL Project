# In this SQL depository I am going to be working with a dataset called chinook.
# Which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

# Once I familiarized myself with the database I then set out to answer some select questions about the data


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

      SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country FROM Customers
      WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

      SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country FROM Customers
      WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

      SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry FROM customers
      JOIN invoices
      ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
      WHERE customers.Country = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

      SELECT * FROM employees
      WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

     SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

      SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName FROM invoices
      JOIN customers
      ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
      JOIN employees
      ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

      SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.Total, customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country, employees.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName, employees.LastName AS EmployeeLastName FROM invoices
      JOIN customers
      ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
      JOIN employees
      ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

      SELECT COUNT(invoices.InvoiceId) FROM invoices
      WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

      SELECT COUNT(invoices.InvoiceId), SUM(invoices.Total) FROM invoices
      WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

      SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name FROM invoice_items
      JOIN tracks
      ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
      ORDER BY invoice_items.InvoiceLineId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

      SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name AS Song, artists.Name AS Artist FROM invoice_items
      JOIN tracks
      ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
      JOIN albums
      ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
      JOIN artists
      ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
      ORDER BY invoice_items.InvoiceLineId;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

      SELECT tracks.Name AS Song, albums.Title AS AlbumTitle, media_types.Name AS Media, genres.Name AS Genre FROM tracks
      JOIN albums
      ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
      JOIN media_types
      ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
      JOIN genres
      ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId
      ORDER BY tracks.TrackId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

      SELECT employees.EmployeeId, employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2) FROM employees
      JOIN customers
      ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
      JOIN invoices
      ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
      GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId
      ORDER BY SUM(invoices.Total) desc;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

      SELECT employees.EmployeeId, employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2) FROM employees
      JOIN customers
      ON employees.EmployeeId = customers.SupportRepId
      JOIN invoices
      ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
      WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
      GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId
      ORDER BY SUM(invoices.Total) desc
      LIMIT 1;
